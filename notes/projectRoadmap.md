# Project Roadmap: Next.js to Vite React Conversion

## Project Goals
- Convert the existing Next.js application to use Vite + React while maintaining all functionality
- Ensure smooth development experience with hot module replacement
- Maintain TypeScript support and type safety
- Preserve existing UI components and styling

## Key Features to Maintain
- [x] React with TypeScript support
- [ ] Tailwind CSS integration
- [ ] All UI components (shadcn/ui components)
- [ ] Theme switching functionality
- [ ] Static asset serving
- [ ] Component organization
- [ ] Development server hot reload

## Technical Requirements
1. Build System Migration
   - [ ] Replace Next.js build system with Vite
   - [ ] Configure Vite for TypeScript support
   - [ ] Set up Vite's static asset handling
   - [ ] Configure environment variables

2. Routing System
   - [ ] Replace Next.js file-based routing with React Router
   - [ ] Set up route configurations
   - [ ] Implement layouts and nested routes

3. Component Updates
   - [ ] Update component imports and exports
   - [ ] Adapt components to work without Next.js specific features
   - [ ] Maintain shadcn/ui component functionality

4. Styling System
   - [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS with Vite
   - [ ] Maintain existing styling utilities
   - [ ] Update any Next.js specific style imports

5. Development Experience
   - [ ] Set up development server
   - [ ] Configure hot module replacement
   - [ ] Update npm scripts
   - [ ] Configure linting and TypeScript

## Completion Criteria
- All components render correctly
- Development server runs without errors
- Build process completes successfully
- Type checking passes
- Styling system works as expected
- All routes work correctly
- Theme switching functions properly

## Migration Steps
1. Initial Setup
   - [ ] Create new Vite project structure
   - [ ] Configure TypeScript
   - [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS

2. Core Migration
   - [ ] Migrate components
   - [ ] Set up routing
   - [ ] Configure static assets

3. Build & Deploy
   - [ ] Configure build process
   - [ ] Test production build
   - [ ] Update deployment scripts

## Completed Tasks
- Created project documentation structure

## Future Considerations
- Performance optimization opportunities with Vite
- Potential for code splitting improvements
- Enhanced development experience with Vite's faster HMR
