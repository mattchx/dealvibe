## Database Schema (Turso)

```sql

    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    original_price DECIMAL,
    store TEXT NOT NULL,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
    image_url TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE INDEX deals_category_idx ON deals(category);
CREATE INDEX deals_created_at_idx ON deals(created_at);
CREATE INDEX deals_store_idx ON deals(store);
```

## Implementation Phases

- [ ] Create form component structure
- [ ] Implement form fields with basic validation
- [ ] Add image upload functionality
- [ ] Implement URL validation and preview
- [ ] Add form progress saving
- [ ] Create success/error states

### Phase 2: Backend Integration (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Set up Turso database schema
- [ ] Create API endpoints for deal submission
- [ ] Implement image upload pipeline
- [ ] Add URL validation service
- [ ] Create draft saving functionality

### Phase 3: Deal Display Updates (Week 2)
- [ ] Update DealCard component
- [ ] Create DealPreview component
- [ ] Implement real-time preview
- [ ] Add share functionality
- [ ] Update DealGrid for new card format

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 2-3)
- [ ] User testing of form submission
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Form accessibility audit

## Integration Points

### Better Auth Integration
- User authentication check before form access
- User data association with deals
- Permission handling for editing/deleting

### Future Feature Preparation
1. **Comments System**
   - Deal ID structure ready for comments
   - UI space reserved in deal detail view

2. **Upvote System**
   - Deal schema includes vote tracking fields
   - UI elements reserved in deal card

3. **Gamification**
   - User points for deal posting
   - Deal quality metrics tracking

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully submit deals
- Form provides clear feedback
- Drafts are reliably saved
- Images are properly optimized
- Mobile experience is smooth
- Load times under 2 seconds
- Failed submissions under 1%

## Monitoring & Analytics
- Track form completion rates
- Monitor submission success/failure
- Track deal engagement metrics
- Monitor image upload performance
- Track user feedback/issues

## Next Steps
After completion, move on to:
1. Comment system implementation
2. Upvote functionality
3. Mobile optimization improvements
